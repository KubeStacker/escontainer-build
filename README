Introduction
------------

The escore-build project builds everything in a clean mock chroot
environment just like redhat/centos does.

The iso build process is based on lorax - a open source iso build
tool from redhat/centos.  The result iso is anaconda install iso -
yet another redhat/centos open source software.


Scripts
-------

setup.sh:
 -> Copy the necessary settings and initialize mock environment.
    This script should be used before running other scripts.
    Two options are also available on demand:
      --server=SERVER
      --config=CONFIG

build_iso.sh:
 -> Build "EasyStack Cloud Linux" ISO image.

make_repos.sh:
 -> Create easystack repository for mock / installer / iso environment.
    After running this script, one must copy the result to the server
    with httpd service.

shell.sh:
 -> Enter mock environment if one would like to try some commands.

clean.sh:
 -> Cleanup mock cache and all the stuff we created.


Note
----

1. Since we use mock environment to build packages and iso image, a user
   should become a member of the mock group by adding their username
   to the mock line in /etc/group.
   This can be done with the following command:

     $ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G mock $USER

2. During the process we need stuff provided by http service from remote.
   So make sure that the services are available on the server and the directory
   locations are correct.

     http://[server]/ESCL/7.3.1611/os
     http://[server]/ESCL/7.3.1611/updates
     http://[server]/ESCL/7.3.1611/easystack
